#### ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

#### ðŸ“¥ Examples:

---

### ðŸ“˜ Example Cases for Palindrome Number

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `x = 121`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:** `x = -121`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

---

#### Example 3:

**Input:** `x = 10`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

---

#### Example 4:

**Input:** `x = 1221`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** 1221 reversed is also 1221. It is a palindrome.

---

#### Example 5:

**Input:** `x = 123`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** 123 reversed is 321. They are not the same, so it's not a palindrome.
